## Revenue Scale Indicators (Estimated)

|---|---|---|---|
| **Enroll360** | 1,200+ schools | Marketing fees + lead gen | Largest |
| **Navigate360** | 850+ institutions (95%+ renewal) | SaaS enterprise licence | Second-largest |

## Competitive Positioning

| Dimension | EAB | Project Zeus |
|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Full lifecycle (recruit to alumni) | Focused on upstream targeting research |
| **Revenue model** | SaaS + services + lead gen | Data/insights product |
| **Data sources** | Proprietary (Appily) + third-party | Public/open data (ABS, Google Trends, IVI, ANZSCO) |
| **Geography** | Primarily US/Canada | Australia-focused |
| **Differentiation** | Integrated platform + scale | Granular, transparent, AU-specific targeting intelligence |

**Key insight for Zeus:** EAB's moat comes from integrated services, proprietary student intent data (Appily), and enterprise licensing models. Zeus differentiates on public/open data, granular AU-specific intelligence, and transparent methodology. The direct admissions space is growing rapidly — as it becomes infrastructure rather than a differentiator, the real competitive battleground shifts back to upstream targeting and audience strategy, which is Zeus's domain.
