title: Squiz University CMS
---

**Squiz** is an Australian-founded Digital Experience Platform (DXP) that dominates the university CMS market. Their platform combines content management (Squiz Matrix), enterprise search (Funnelback, originally developed by ANU/CSIRO), personalization, analytics, and forms into a single SaaS offering. Squiz claims that **over half of Australian and New Zealand universities** use their platform — roughly 22+ of Australia's ~43 universities.

## Platform Capabilities

### Content Management (Squiz Matrix)
- Visual Page Builder with drag-and-drop components (no-code)
- 1,000+ content authors supported at scale (University of Melbourne)
- Design system support for consistent branding across faculties
- Multi-site management (Monash runs 125+ internet/intranet sites)

### Personalization & Testing
- **A/B testing** — trial messaging, layouts, and CTAs using real data
- **Personalized content delivery** — tailor pages based on visitor attributes
- **Course finder tools** — interactive search for prospective students

### Search (Funnelback)
- Enterprise search across university content
- Originally developed by ANU and CSIRO, now part of Squiz DXP

## Relevance to Project Zeus

Squiz is the **execution layer** where university marketing teams act on targeting decisions. Zeus is the **intelligence layer** that informs those decisions. They are complementary:

| Zeus Output | Squiz Capability | Actionable Integration |
|---|---|---|
| **Who** — demographic segments with unmet demand | Personalization engine | Personalize landing pages by age/gender segment |
| **Where** — high-opportunity LGAs and states | A/B testing | Test geo-targeted messaging for specific regions |
| **What message** — field-of-study demand, career outcomes | Content management | Create field-specific landing pages with outcome proof points |
| Opportunity gap fields | Course finder | Promote high-gap courses more prominently |
| Trending interests | A/B testing | Test timely messaging hooks identified from Google Trends |

Zeus doesn't need to integrate with Squiz technically. The value is in packaging recommendations so they map to actions a Squiz user can take — e.g., "create a personalized landing page for 25-34yo women in Western Sydney interested in nursing" is directly executable in Squiz's Visual Page Builder + personalization engine.
