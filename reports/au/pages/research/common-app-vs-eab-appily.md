title: Common App vs EAB Appily vs UCAS
---

Understanding how admissions platforms work in the US, UK, and Australia contextualises how student preference data is generated and captured. Each market has fundamentally different structures — creating different data dynamics and marketing implications for university enrollment marketing.

For the Australian TAC breakdown, see [Australian Tertiary Admissions Centres](/research/australian-tertiary-admissions-centres).

## Overview

Three major admissions platforms dominate the US and UK markets, each with a fundamentally different model:

| Dimension | Common App (US) | Appily / EAB (US) | UCAS (UK) |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Primary function** | Standardised application form | College discovery + direct admissions matching | Centralised national application gateway |
| **Founded** | 1975 (non-profit) | 2023 rebrand (for-profit, EAB/Vista Equity) | 1961 (non-profit charity) |
| **Revenue model** | Application fees ($60 base) + membership | Pay-per-lead from institutions | Application fees (£28.50) + data products |
| **Member institutions** | 1,100+ | 4,000+ profiles; 180+ direct admission partners | ~400 UK providers (near-universal) |
| **Annual applicants** | ~1.5M distinct, ~10.2M applications (2024-25) | 3M+ student users | ~765,000 applicants; ~578,000 accepted (2025) |
| **Student cost** | $60 + per-institution fees (waivers available) | Free | £28.50 for up to 5 choices |
| **Geographic scope** | US + 20 countries | Primarily US | UK + international applicants |
| **Mandate** | Voluntary — institutions opt in | Voluntary — institutions opt in | Near-mandatory — almost all UK unis require it |

## How Each Platform Works

### Common App — Application Processing

Common App is a **standardised application form** accepted by 1,100+ institutions. The student completes one profile (demographics, academics, activities, essay) and submits it to multiple schools. Each school can add supplemental questions.

The platform is a **non-profit** whose mission is to expand access to higher education. It publishes comprehensive end-of-season reports with aggregate application trends, demographic breakdowns, and state-level data.

### Common App Direct Admissions

Launched 2023-24, expanded to **200+ partner institutions** in 34 states for 2025-26. Targets first-generation and lower-income students specifically.

**How it works:** Institutions set minimum GPA and state residency criteria. Common App identifies eligible students and sends proactive admission offers via email — no additional application needed. Offers include automatic application fee waivers. Non-binding.

**Key limitation:** Relies on **self-reported GPA**. No transcript verification.

### Appily (EAB) — Discovery + Direct Admissions

Appily is EAB's **student-facing platform** that consolidated several acquisitions (Cappex, College Greenlight, YouVisit, Concourse) into a single college planning destination. It's free for students and monetised through institutional lead generation.

**Appily Match** is the **reverse admissions** component — institutions proactively send admission and scholarship offers to students. Students create free profiles (~30 min), school counsellors submit and certify transcripts, anonymised profiles are delivered to partner institutions, and institutions extend real admission + scholarship offers.

**Scale (2025):** 180+ partner colleges, 450K+ admission offers made, $14B+ in scholarship offers extended, 6,000+ partner high schools, 72% of US high school students have access.

### UCAS — UK National Admissions Service

UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) is the **centralised national application gateway** for virtually all undergraduate study in the UK. Students create a single application with up to 5 course choices (£28.50 flat fee), universities make conditional or unconditional offers, and students firm one choice and insure another.

UCAS is structurally closest to **Australian TACs** — a mandatory centralised gateway that processes applications and manages offers. The key difference is that Australian TACs are state-based while UCAS is national.

UCAS publishes **exceptionally detailed public data** — the most comprehensive of any admissions platform globally. Downloadable CSV files include applicants and acceptances by subject group, breakdowns by sex, area background, and ethnic group at provider level, application rates by age, domicile, and deprivation quintile.

## Full US Application Platform Landscape

The US market is **fragmented and competitive** — students often use 2-3 platforms simultaneously.

### Application Platforms (Student-Initiated)

| Platform | Type | Scale | Key Feature |
|----------|------|-------|-------------|
| **Common App** | Standardised form | 1,100+ institutions, ~1.5M applicants/yr | Dominant platform; one form, many schools |

## Key Differences

### Application Model

| **Who initiates** | Student applies to institutions | Institutions offer to students | Student applies to institutions |
| **Effort required** | Full application (essay, activities, supplements) | Profile only (~30 min), no essay | Full application (personal statement, reference) |
| **Verification** | Self-reported academics | Transcript-verified by school counsellor | School/college verifies predicted grades |
| **Rejections** | Yes | No — students only see acceptances | Yes |
| **Choice limit** | Unlimited institutions | Unlimited matches | 5 courses maximum |

### Data Quality Ranking for Audience Profiling

| Platform | FOS Preferences | Demographics | Geography | Applicant Type | Public? | Overall |
|----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| **UAC** | Yes | Gender, age | State-level | Year 12/Non-Year 12/Interstate | Yes | **Best for AU** |
| **UCAS** | Yes (subject group) | Sex, ethnicity, deprivation | Domicile | Age bands | Yes | **Best for UK** |
| **Common App** | No | Race, income, first-gen | State-level | No | Aggregate only | Limited |
| **Appily** | Likely yes | Likely yes | Likely yes | Unknown | **No** | Inaccessible |

## Cross-Country Structural Comparison

| Dimension | Australian TACs | Common App (US) | Appily (US) | UCAS (UK) |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Mandate** | Quasi-mandatory per state | Voluntary | Voluntary | Near-mandatory nationally |
| **Competition** | Monopoly per state | Competitive market | Competitive market | National monopoly |
| **Data availability** | Varies by TAC; UAC is best | Aggregate public reports | Proprietary only | **Extensive** public CSVs |
| **Funding** | Fee-based non-profit | Non-profit | For-profit (Vista Equity) | Non-profit charity |
| **Direct admissions** | No | Yes (200+ partners) | Yes (180+ partners) | No (Clearing is post-results only) |

**For Project Zeus:** UCAS and UAC both publish granular public data by subject group, gender, and geography — making them the two most useful open data sources for audience profiling. See the [UK Data Sources Roadmap](/research/uk-data-sources-roadmap) for how UCAS data maps to the UK pipeline.
