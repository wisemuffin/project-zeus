title: NSW Education Platforms — K-12 vs Higher Ed
---

Comparison of K-12 school administration platforms and higher education systems in Australia. Research into **School Bytes**, **Compass Education**, **Sentral**, **Hero**, and **Millennium FAST**, plus the enterprise systems Australian universities actually use (**TechnologyOne**, **Ellucian Banner**, legacy **Callista/PeopleSoft**).

## K-12 Platform Overviews

### School Bytes (now a Compass company)

School administration SaaS built specifically for **NSW public schools**. Acquired by Compass Education in February 2025 (Compass backed by EQT, a major European PE firm). Strongest in NSW public school finance with deep SAP integration (NSW DoE's finance backbone). AMPS-approved supplier.

### Compass Education

**Australia's most-used all-in-one school management software**, serving 3,000+ schools across Australia, Ireland, and the UK. 40+ customisable modules with monthly updates. Broadest platform with timetabling (Schedule Builder), canteen ordering, analytics (Pulse), and room management.

### Sentral

Comprehensive cloud-hosted school management platform serving **250,000+ teachers** and **1.2 million+ students**. 35+ modules across government, independent, and Catholic sectors. ISO 27001 certified, Microsoft Azure hosted. **Strongest business management suite** among K-12 tools with accounts payable, purchase orders, and payment gateway.

### Hero

**Learner-centred school management and learning portfolio platform** focused primarily on **Australian primary schools**. Key differentiator: combines SMS admin with an **LMS-style learning portfolio** (real-time photo/video capture of student work, digital badges, goal-setting). The other three platforms are pure administration tools.

## Feature Overlap Matrix

| Feature Area | School Bytes | Compass | Sentral | Hero |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Attendance / Roll Marking** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Student Wellbeing / Behaviour** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Academic Reports** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (+ portfolios) |
| **Learning Portfolios / LMS** | No | No | No | **Yes (core strength)** |
| **Student Finance / Payments** | Yes (SAP integrated) | Yes | Yes | Yes (AMPS approved) |
| **Parent Portal** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Mobile App** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Timetabling** | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Canteen / Online Orders** | No | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Curriculum Management** | Yes | Limited | Yes | Yes |
| **Analytics / Insights** | Limited | Yes (Pulse) | Yes | Yes |

**Key observations:** Near-total overlap in core admin features. Compass is the broadest. Sentral has the strongest business suite. Hero is the outlier with learning portfolios. Now that Compass owns School Bytes, the combined entity controls two AMPS-approved student finance suppliers.

## Timetabling Comparison

| Capability | School Bytes | Compass | Sentral | Hero |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Full timetabling** | No | **Yes** | **Yes** | No |
| **Class/subject allocation** | Partial | **Yes** | **Yes** | No |
| **Student subject selection** | No | Via Griddle integration | **Yes** | No |
| **Room allocation** | No | **Yes** | **Yes** | No |

Schools that need end-to-end timetabling (particularly secondary schools) are choosing between **Compass** and **Sentral**.

## Do Universities Use These K-12 Tools?

**No.** Universities have fundamentally different needs: tens of thousands of students, multiple faculties, research programs, TEQSA/ESOS/CRICOS compliance, HECS-HELP administration, and research grant management.

## Systems Australian Universities Actually Use

| System | Vendor | Australian Presence |
|---|---|---|
| **TechnologyOne Student Management** | TechnologyOne (ASX: TNE, Brisbane) | **Dominant. 60%+ of Australian higher ed.** 2M+ students. |
| **Ellucian Banner** | Ellucian (US) | Growing. Major recent wins (Monash, Western Sydney). |
| **Callista** | Tribal Group (now Ellucian) | Legacy. Originally built at Deakin Uni in the 1990s. |
| **Oracle PeopleSoft** | Oracle | Legacy. ~11 Australian unis historically. |
| **Millennium FAST** | MCSL | BI/reporting layer for university ERPs. Not a standalone SMS. |

Other enterprise systems: Salesforce/Dynamics 365 (CRM), Moodle/Canvas/Blackboard (LMS), Allocate+/Syllabus Plus (timetabling).

**Key takeaway:** The Australian university SMS market is dominated by **TechnologyOne** (homegrown, ASX-listed, 60%+ market share) with **Ellucian** as the main challenger. K-12 and higher ed systems are completely separate domains.
