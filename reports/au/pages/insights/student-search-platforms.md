title: Student Search & Matching Platforms
---

How do prospective students discover universities, and how can institutions intercept that journey? Understanding the platforms students use to search for courses and universities is critical for digital marketing strategy. These platforms represent high-intent touchpoints where prospective students are actively in decision-making mode.

## USA Market

### Appily (formerly Cappex) — The Market Leader

**Owner:** EAB (Education Advisory Board)
**Scale:** 3M+ students, 4,000+ college profiles

Appily is an all-in-one college planning platform that consolidated several EAB acquisitions (Cappex, YouVisit, College Greenlight, Concourse) into a single destination launched September 2023.

**Key features:**
- College search with filters (major, cost, location, GPA/SAT/ACT)
- Scholarship database (~250,000 scholarships, ~$50M total value)
- Virtual campus tours (via YouVisit tech)
- Admission chances calculator
- **Direct Admissions** — schools can proactively extend admission offers to students who complete profiles, reversing the traditional application flow

**Business model (for universities):**
- Pay-per-lead / candidate acquisition — universities purchase qualified student leads
- Appily Advance (graduate/adult programs) costs ~70% less per lead than Meta/LinkedIn/paid search
- Appily Match requires students to submit transcripts upfront, giving institutions verified qualifications
- Students acquired through Appily are **20x more likely to deposit** than traditional search names
- Custom pricing via consultation (no public rate card)

**Marketing relevance:** Appily is essentially a **demand capture** channel — students are already searching. Universities pay to be visible and to receive warm leads. The Direct Admissions feature is particularly disruptive: it flips the funnel so institutions apply to students.

## Australia Market

The Australian landscape is structurally different — the Tertiary Admission Centres (TACs) play a centralised role that doesn't exist in the US. There is no single dominant "Appily equivalent" but rather a mix of government, semi-government, and commercial platforms.

### Government / Semi-Government Platforms

| Platform | Owner | Role |
|----------|-------|------|
| **CourseSeeker** | Australian Government (Dept of Education) | National course search for 3,000+ undergraduate & postgraduate courses |
| **ComparED / QILT** | Australian Government | Compare student experience, satisfaction, and graduate employment outcomes across institutions |
| **Study Assist** | Australian Government | HECS-HELP information + course comparison |
| **UAC** (Universities Admissions Centre) | NSW/ACT consortium | Course search + centralised applications for NSW/ACT |
| **QTAC** | QLD consortium | Course search + applications for QLD/Northern NSW (1,800+ courses) |
| **VTAC, SATAC, TISC** | State consortia | Equivalent TACs for VIC, SA, WA respectively |

### Commercial Platforms

| Platform | Model | Focus |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Good Universities Guide** | Lead gen + advertising | Course comparison, institution profiles, direct enquiry links |
| **StudySelect** | Commission per lead | Markets courses from universities, TAFEs, and colleges; earns commission per prospective student referral |
| **CourseFinder** | Lead gen / ad-supported | 500+ online courses from Australian universities and TAFEs |
| **Hotcourses / IDP** | Part of IDP Education | Strong in international student recruitment; partnerships with 500+ universities globally |
| **Unibuddy** | SaaS for institutions | Peer-to-peer: connects prospective students with current student ambassadors |
| **Adventus.io** | Marketplace / commission | International student recruitment marketplace connecting agents, institutions, and students |
| **University Reviews** | Ad-supported | Student-generated reviews (similar concept to Niche) |

## Key Differences: USA vs Australia

| Dimension | USA | Australia |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| **Market structure** | Fragmented, competitive, heavily commercialised | Centralised via TACs + government portals |
| **Lead gen maturity** | Highly mature — Appily, Niche sell verified leads at scale | Less mature — Good Universities Guide and StudySelect are closest equivalents |
| **Direct admissions** | Appily pioneered "schools apply to students" | Not established; TAC-based application is the norm |
| **Data richness** | SAT/ACT scores, GPA, transcripts feed matching algorithms | ATAR-based, but less commercial data exchange |
| **International recruitment** | Separate ecosystem (agents, EducationUSA) | IDP/Hotcourses/Adventus.io are major players |
| **Cost transparency** | Niche avg ~$10K/yr subscription; Appily custom pricing | Less publicly documented pricing |

## Marketing Implications for Universities

### Demand Capture Strategy
These platforms represent **bottom-of-funnel** touchpoints — students are actively searching. Universities should:
1. **Ensure presence** on the dominant platforms in their target market
2. **Optimise profiles** with compelling content, virtual tours, and clear value propositions
3. **Purchase leads** strategically from high-conversion platforms (Appily leads are 20x more likely to deposit)

### Platform Selection by Objective
| Objective | USA Platform | AUS Platform |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Broad domestic reach | Appily, Niche, BigFuture | CourseSeeker, Good Universities Guide |
| High-intent leads | Appily Match (transcript-verified) | StudySelect, Good Universities Guide |
| Peer influence / social proof | Niche (reviews), Unibuddy | University Reviews, Unibuddy |
| International students | Separate channels | IDP/Hotcourses, Adventus.io |
| Application pipeline | Common App, Coalition | UAC, QTAC, VTAC (state TACs) |

### Where Project Zeus Fits
Understanding which platforms students use helps us:
- **Target ads** to audiences who are also active on these platforms (lookalike audiences)
- **Benchmark messaging** — what information are students searching for? (cost, outcomes, location)
- **Identify gaps** — if a university is underrepresented on high-traffic platforms, that's a quick win
- **Inform content strategy** — trending search terms on these platforms signal what messaging resonates
