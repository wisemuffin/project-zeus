> UK, and Australia contextualises how student preference data is generated and captured.
> Each market has fundamentally different structures — creating different data dynamics
> and marketing implications for university enrollment marketing.

## Overview

Three major admissions platforms dominate the US and UK markets, each with a
fundamentally different model:

| Dimension | Common App (US) | Appily / EAB (US) | UCAS (UK) |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Primary function** | Standardised application form | College discovery + direct admissions matching | Centralised national application gateway |
| **Founded** | 1975 (non-profit) | 2023 rebrand (for-profit, EAB/Vista Equity) | 1961 (non-profit charity) |
| **Revenue model** | Application fees ($60 base) + membership | Pay-per-lead from institutions | Application fees (£28.50) + data products |
| **Member institutions** | 1,100+ | 4,000+ profiles; 180+ direct admission partners | ~400 UK providers (near-universal) |
| **Annual applicants** | ~1.5M distinct, ~10.2M applications (2024–25) | 3M+ student users | ~765,000 applicants; ~578,000 accepted (2025) |
| **Student cost** | $60 + per-institution fees (waivers available) | Free | £28.50 for up to 5 choices |
| **Geographic scope** | US + 20 countries | Primarily US | UK + international applicants |
| **Mandate** | Voluntary — institutions opt in | Voluntary — institutions opt in | Near-mandatory — almost all UK unis require it |

## How Each Platform Works

### Common App — Application Processing

Common App is a **standardised application form** accepted by 1,100+ institutions. The
student completes one profile (demographics, academics, activities, essay) and submits it
to multiple schools. Each school can add supplemental questions.

The platform is a **non-profit** whose mission is to expand access to higher education.
It publishes comprehensive [end-of-season reports](https://www.commonapp.org/about/reports-and-insights/)
with aggregate application trends, demographic breakdowns, and state-level data.

**Key data points published:**
- Total applicants and applications by year
- Demographic breakdowns (race/ethnicity, first-generation, income)
- Test score submission trends (only ~5% of members now require scores, down from 55% in 2019–20)
- State-level application volumes and trends

### Common App Direct Admissions

Launched 2023–24, expanded to **200+ partner institutions** in 34 states for 2025–26.
Targets first-generation and lower-income students specifically.

**How it works:**
1. Institutions set minimum GPA and state residency criteria
2. Common App identifies eligible students from their existing applicant pool
3. Students receive proactive admission offers via email — no additional application needed
4. Offers include automatic application fee waivers
5. Non-binding — students can accept or keep exploring

**Key limitation:** Relies on **self-reported GPA**. No transcript verification.

### Appily (EAB) — Discovery + Direct Admissions

Appily is EAB's **student-facing platform** that consolidated several acquisitions
(Cappex, College Greenlight, YouVisit, Concourse) into a single college planning
destination. It's free for students and monetised through institutional lead generation.

**Student features:**
- College search across 4,000+ institutions
- ~250,000 scholarships ($50M+ total value)
- Virtual campus tours (via YouVisit technology)
- Admission chances calculator
- Direct admissions matching (Appily Match)

### Appily Match — Direct Admissions

Appily Match is the **reverse admissions** component — institutions proactively send
admission and scholarship offers to students. This is the most direct competitor to
Common App Direct Admissions.

**How it works:**
1. Students create free profiles (~30 min) — classes, hobbies, career aspirations, grades
2. School counsellors submit and certify transcripts
3. Anonymised profiles are delivered to partner institutions based on selection criteria
4. Institutions extend real admission + scholarship offers (typically 1–2 weeks)
5. Students only see acceptances — no rejections communicated

**Scale (2025):**
- 180+ partner colleges
- 450K+ admission offers made
- $14B+ in scholarship offers extended
- 6,000+ partner high schools
- 72% of US high school students have access

### UCAS — UK National Admissions Service

UCAS (Universities and Colleges Admissions Service) is the **centralised national
application gateway** for virtually all undergraduate study in the UK. Unlike the US
market where platforms compete for students, UCAS is effectively a monopoly — almost
every UK university requires applicants to go through UCAS.

**How it works:**
1. Students create a single application with up to 5 course choices (£28.50 flat fee)
2. Application includes personal statement, academic record, and teacher reference
3. Universities make conditional or unconditional offers
4. Students firm one choice and insure another
5. Results day (August) — conditional offers confirmed or rejected based on exam results
6. **Clearing** — unplaced students matched with courses that have vacancies (July–October)

UCAS is structurally closest to **Australian TACs** — a mandatory centralised gateway
that processes applications and manages offers. The key difference is that Australian
TACs are state-based while UCAS is national.

#### UCAS Public Data

UCAS publishes **exceptionally detailed public data** — the most comprehensive of any
admissions platform globally. Available as downloadable CSV files (sector-level: ~133MB,
provider-level: ~173MB):

- **Applicants and acceptances by subject group** — field-of-study demand signals
- **Breakdowns by sex, area background, and ethnic group** — demographic cross-tabulations
  at provider level for 130+ universities
- **Application rates by age, domicile, and deprivation quintile** — geographic and
  socioeconomic analysis
- **End-of-cycle reports** — comprehensive annual publications with time-series data
- **In-cycle releases** — applicant figures published at key deadlines (e.g. 15 October,
  January deadline)

UCAS also offers **EXACT** — a commercial data product providing granular, bespoke
datasets in CSV format for institutional subscribers.

#### UCAS Clearing — The Closest Thing to "Direct Admissions"

Clearing is UCAS's mechanism for matching unplaced students with available courses after
results day. It's not proactive direct admissions (institutions don't pre-offer), but it
serves a similar function — connecting supply and demand in real time.

Since 2022, UCAS has introduced **Clearing Plus** (now "Your Clearing Matches"), which
uses data to proactively suggest courses to unplaced students based on their profile —
moving closer to the direct admissions model.

## Key Differences

### 1. Application Model

| | Common App (US) | Appily (US) | UCAS (UK) |
|--|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Who initiates** | Student applies to institutions | Institutions offer to students | Student applies to institutions |
| **Effort required** | Full application (essay, activities, supplements) | Profile only (~30 min), no essay | Full application (personal statement, reference) |
| **Verification** | Self-reported academics | Transcript-verified by school counsellor | School/college verifies predicted grades |
| **Rejections** | Yes — students receive rejections | No — students only see acceptances | Yes — students receive rejections |
| **Choice limit** | Unlimited institutions | Unlimited matches | 5 courses maximum |

Common App is **student-driven and unlimited** — students can apply to as many schools as
they can afford. UCAS is **student-driven but constrained** — the 5-choice limit forces
deliberate decision-making. Appily Match is **institution-driven** — schools proactively
find and recruit students who match their criteria.

### 2. Business Model & Incentives

**Common App** is a non-profit. Revenue comes from application fees and institutional
membership. Its incentive is to maximise application volume and access.

**Appily** is owned by EAB (Vista Equity Partners). Revenue comes from institutions
paying for student leads. Its incentive is to maximise student engagement and lead
quality for institutional partners. Appily feeds into EAB's broader Enroll360 enrollment
marketing suite — direct-admitted students who don't yield become prospects for EAB's
Yield module campaigns.

This creates a structural difference: Common App is a **utility** (standardised form
processing), while Appily is a **marketplace** (matching supply and demand for mutual
benefit, monetised on the institutional side).

### 3. Data Quality

Appily Match's **transcript verification** is a genuine differentiator. Common App Direct
Admissions relies on self-reported GPA, which introduces data quality risk for
institutions. For marketing research purposes, transcript-verified data would produce
more reliable audience profiles.

### 4. Target Population

**Common App Direct Admissions** explicitly targets first-generation and lower-income
students — it's an access initiative with equity goals.

**Appily Match** targets all college-bound students without income restrictions. Its
Naviance integration gives it access to 6M+ students via the dominant high school
counselling platform.

### 5. Scale and Distribution

| Metric | Common App (US) | Appily (US) | UCAS (UK) |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Member institutions** | 1,100+ (apps) / 200+ (direct admits) | 180+ (direct admits) | ~400 (near-universal) |
| **Student reach** | ~1.5M applicants/year | 3M+ users; 72% of seniors via Naviance | ~765K applicants/year |
| **Data published** | Aggregate public reports | Proprietary — partners only | **Extensive** public CSVs + reports |

Common App has the broadest US institutional coverage. Appily has the deepest student
reach via Naviance. UCAS has the richest public data — downloadable CSV datasets with
subject-group, sex, ethnicity, and deprivation breakdowns at provider level.

## Cross-Country Structural Comparison

| Dimension | Australian TACs | Common App (US) | Appily (US) | UCAS (UK) |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Mandate** | Quasi-mandatory per state | Voluntary | Voluntary | Near-mandatory nationally |
| **Competition** | Monopoly per state | Competitive market | Competitive market | National monopoly |
| **Ranking system** | TACs calculate ATARs | No equivalent (SAT/ACT separate) | No equivalent | No equivalent (A-levels separate) |
| **Data availability** | Varies by TAC; UAC is best | Aggregate public reports | Proprietary only | **Extensive** public CSVs |
| **Funding** | Fee-based non-profit | Non-profit | For-profit (Vista Equity) | Non-profit charity |
| **Direct admissions** | No | Yes (200+ partners) | Yes (180+ partners) | No (Clearing is post-results only) |

**UCAS is the closest international analogue to Australian TACs** — both are mandatory
centralised gateways that process applications for their jurisdiction. The key difference
is scope: UCAS is national while Australian TACs are state-based.

**For Project Zeus:** UCAS and UAC both publish granular public data by subject group,
gender, and geography — making them the two most useful open data sources for audience
profiling across the markets we may expand into. Common App publishes useful aggregate
trends but not field-of-study preference breakdowns. Appily's data is proprietary and
not publicly accessible.

## Implications for Market Research

### What Common App data can tell us
- Application volume trends year over year (demand signals)
- Demographic shifts in the applicant pool (who to target)
- Test-optional adoption rates (changing admissions landscape)
- State-level application patterns (where demand originates)

### What Common App data cannot tell us
- Field-of-study preferences (not published at this granularity)
- Applicant type breakdowns (mature learner vs school leaver equivalent)
- Gender × field-of-study cross-tabulations

### What Appily data could tell us (but is proprietary)
- Real-time student interest signals by field, geography, and demographics
- Yield rates for direct-admitted vs conventionally-admitted students
- Career aspiration data from student profiles

### What UCAS data can tell us
- **Applicants and acceptances by subject group** — field-of-study demand (comparable to UAC FOS data)
- **Breakdowns by sex and ethnic group** — demographic cross-tabulations at provider level
- **Deprivation quintile analysis** — socioeconomic targeting signals (no AU equivalent)
- **Application rates by age and domicile** — mature learner and geographic signals
- Downloadable as CSV — suitable for automated pipeline ingestion

### What UCAS data cannot tell us
- Applicant type segmentation comparable to UAC's Year 12 / Non-Year 12 / Interstate split
- Real-time preference data (end-of-cycle reports are retrospective, published annually)

### What UAC data uniquely provides
- Field-of-study preference shares by applicant type, gender, and geography
- Mature learner index (Non-Year 12 over-indexing by field)
- Interstate draw ratios (geographic demand signals)
- Public and free — no institutional partnership required

### Data quality ranking for audience profiling

| Platform | FOS Preferences | Demographics | Geography | Applicant Type | Public? | Overall |
|----------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|
| **UAC** | Yes | Gender, age | State-level | Year 12/Non-Year 12/Interstate | Yes | **Best for AU** |
| **UCAS** | Yes (subject group) | Sex, ethnicity, deprivation | Domicile | Age bands | Yes | **Best for UK** |
| **Common App** | No | Race, income, first-gen | State-level | No | Aggregate only | Limited |
| **Appily** | Likely yes | Likely yes | Likely yes | Unknown | **No** | Inaccessible |
