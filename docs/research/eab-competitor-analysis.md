## Company Overview

EAB (formerly the Education Advisory Board) is a technology, research, and services
company that partners with higher education institutions to improve enrolment, student
success, and institutional outcomes. They serve **2,500+ institutions** and **10M+
students** across their platforms.

EAB was originally part of The Advisory Board Company, which split its education
division into a standalone entity. The company is now privately held (acquired by Vista
Equity Partners). Estimated total revenue is **~$175M–$214M** annually (unverified —
no public filings available). Product-level revenue is not disclosed.

## Product Offerings — Scale Indicators

> **Note:** EAB is privately held and does not publish product-level revenue. The scale
> indicators below (institutional reach, partner counts) are the best available proxies
> for relative product weighting.

### 1. Enroll360 - Enrollment Marketing & Recruitment

**Scale: 1,100+ partner schools | Likely largest revenue contributor (marketing + lead gen fees)**

**Directly competes with Project Zeus's targeting use case.**

Enroll360 is EAB's full-funnel enrolment marketing solution that combines marketing
campaigns with proprietary recruitment platforms.

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Audience Strategy** | Data-driven audience identification using proprietary and third-party data to find right-fit students |
| **Marketing Campaigns** | Responsive digital campaigns (paid media, SEO, retargeting, email) to build affinity over time |
| **Cultivate Campaigns** | Inquiry-generation campaigns — students who inquire through Cultivate are reportedly **6.3x more likely to enrol** vs traditional methods |
| **Funnel Analytics** | Performance tracking across the full recruitment funnel |

Enroll360 is trusted by **1,100+ schools** for recruitment marketing.

**Key insight for Zeus:** Enroll360 bundles data-driven audience targeting with campaign
execution. Project Zeus focuses on the upstream research/targeting layer — we need to
be clearer and more granular than EAB's audience strategy to differentiate.

### 2. Navigate360 - CRM & Student Success Platform

**Scale: 850+ institutions, 10M+ students | Core SaaS platform — likely second-largest revenue line**

Navigate360 is the leading higher-education CRM, used by **850+ institutions**. It
covers the full student lifecycle from recruitment through to alumni engagement.

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| **Enrollment CRM** | Prospect management, application tracking, AI-driven engagement prioritisation |
| **Student Success** | Early-alert systems, advisor tools, intervention workflows |
| **Career Services** | Career pathway matching, employer engagement |
| **Alumni & Advancement** | Donor cultivation, alumni engagement tracking |

Partners report **3-15% graduation rate increases** and a typical **5:1 ROI**.

**Key insight for Zeus:** Navigate360's enrollment CRM is the system that would
*consume* the kind of targeting intelligence Zeus produces. Understanding its data model
and integration points could inform how we package our outputs.

### 3. Appily (formerly Cappex) - Student-Facing Lead Generation

**Scale: Multiple acquired brands (Cappex, College Greenlight, YouVisit, Concourse) | Pay-per-lead model — high-margin revenue stream**

Appily is EAB's student-facing platform that aggregates several acquired brands:

| Brand | Function |
|---|---|
| **Cappex** | College search and matching tools |
| **College Greenlight** | Services for underrepresented and first-generation students |
| **YouVisit** | Immersive virtual campus tours |
| **Concourse** | Reverse admissions platform |

Appily generates **high-intent leads** — students actively searching for programmes —
and sells these inquiries to partner institutions. There is a specific **Cappex for
Adult Learners** product targeting graduate and adult degree-completion programmes.

**Key insight for Zeus:** Appily gives EAB a proprietary first-party data asset
(student intent signals). This is a significant competitive moat that would be difficult
to replicate. Zeus should focus on public/open data sources as a differentiator.

### 4. Adult Learner Recruitment

**Scale: 480+ graduate marketing & enrollment partners | 12+ years in segment — feeds into Enroll360 revenue**

A dedicated solution for graduate, online, and adult learner enrolment growth.

- Uses consumer analytics, paid media, SEO, retargeting, and proprietary data sources
  to identify prospective adult learners
- Gamified web experiences to match students to personalised career pathways
- Backed by **12+ years** of experience in the adult learner segment

**Key insight for Zeus:** The adult/postgrad segment is a distinct market with different
targeting needs. Zeus's job market (IVI) and career outcome data assets are directly
relevant here.

### 5. Edify - Data & Analytics Platform

**Scale: Undisclosed partner count | Newer product — likely smaller but growing revenue line (SaaS model)**

Edify is an AI-powered, cloud-native data management platform (hosted on AWS).

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Data Lake/Warehouse** | Vendor-agnostic ingestion via pre-built higher-ed connectors or custom extractions |
| **Self-Service Analytics** | No/low-code data exploration, analysis, and operational reporting |
| **Accelerators** | Pre-built analytic workspaces for strategic priorities (e.g., course planning) |
| **AI Features** | Query Assist (natural language to SQL), Data Search Assist, Query Explainer |
| **BI Integration** | Connects to preferred business intelligence tools for visualisation |

Implementation timeline: core platform in **~10 days**, source system integrations in
**~2 weeks**.

**Key insight for Zeus:** Edify shows EAB investing in self-service analytics. If Zeus
outputs could plug into platforms like Edify (or similar institutional data warehouses),
it would increase adoption.

### 6. Strategic Advisory Services

**Scale: 2,500+ member institutions | Subscription/membership model — legacy revenue base that underpins all other products**

EAB maintains a large research and advisory practice:

- **Research forums** covering enrolment, advancement, academic affairs, and
  institutional strategy
