# EAB - Competitor Analysis

> **Last updated:** 2026-02-20
> **Relevance to Project Zeus:** EAB is a direct competitor in the higher-ed enrollment
> marketing and market research space. Their product suite represents the incumbent
> benchmark for university digital marketing and student acquisition.

## Company Overview

EAB (formerly the Education Advisory Board) is a technology, research, and services
company that partners with higher education institutions to improve enrolment, student
success, and institutional outcomes. They serve **2,500+ institutions** and **10M+
students** across their platforms.

EAB was originally part of The Advisory Board Company, which split its education
division into a standalone entity. The company is now privately held (acquired by Vista
Equity Partners). Estimated total revenue is **~$175M–$214M** annually (unverified —
no public filings available). Product-level revenue is not disclosed.

## Product Offerings — Scale Indicators

> **Note:** EAB is privately held and does not publish product-level revenue. The scale
> indicators below (institutional reach, partner counts) are the best available proxies
> for relative product weighting.

### 1. Enroll360 - Enrollment Marketing & Recruitment

**Scale: 1,200+ partner schools | 1.5B+ student interactions/year | Likely largest revenue contributor**

**Directly competes with Project Zeus's targeting use case.**

Enroll360 is EAB's full-funnel enrolment marketing solution that combines marketing
campaigns with proprietary recruitment platforms. It is built on **1.5+ billion student
interactions** annually.

#### Performance Claims

- **16%** average enrolment increase among first-year partners
- **17%** average increase in net tuition revenue (NTR) among first-year partners
- **6.3x** higher enrolment likelihood for Cultivate campaign students vs traditional methods

#### Four Core Modules

| Module | Stage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Cultivate** | Awareness → Inquiry | Affinity-building campaigns using data-driven audience strategies to identify and nurture right-fit students |
| **Apply** | Inquiry → Application | Demand-generating application marketing with omni-channel strategies and real-time data insights |
| **Aid** | Admission → Yield | Data-driven financial aid policy creation and optimisation to support enrolment growth |
| **Yield** | Admit → Deposit | Actionable yield analytics combining surveying with national data for conversion acceleration |

#### Enroll360 Insight Engine (AI)

- Hyperpersonalised content delivery at scale
- Optimised campaign targeting and budget allocation
- Predictive analytics across the full enrolment funnel
- **Conversation Agent** — AI assistant embedded in outbound emails, landing pages, and
  SMS to engage prospects 24/7

#### Service Model

Each partner gets a dedicated **Strategic Leader** coordinating support across **13
specialist teams** — positioning EAB as an outsourced enrolment marketing department
rather than a point tool.

#### Recruitment Platforms (via Appily)

Enroll360 partners also get access to Appily's lead generation tools:
- Student Leads (Appily Candidates)
- Virtual Tours
- Direct Admission (Appily Match)
- International Student Recruitment (Global Match)

**Key insight for Zeus:** Enroll360 bundles data-driven audience targeting with campaign
execution and has a deeply integrated service model (13 specialist teams per partner).
Project Zeus focuses on the upstream research/targeting layer — we need to be clearer
and more granular than EAB's audience strategy to differentiate. The "Aid" module is
notable: financial aid optimisation is a lever Zeus doesn't currently address.

### 2. Navigate360 - CRM & Student Success Platform

**Scale: 850+ institutions, 10M+ students | 95%+ annual renewal rate | Core SaaS platform — likely second-largest revenue line**

Navigate360 is the leading higher-education CRM, used by **850+ institutions**. It
covers the full student lifecycle from recruitment through to alumni engagement.

#### Performance Claims

- **2-12%** typical retention rate improvement
- **3-15%** typical graduation rate improvement
- **5:1** typical ROI
- **95%+** annual renewal rate

#### Five Core Modules

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| **Enrollment CRM** | Prospect management, communications, automated workflows, custom application builder, Common App integration |
| **Student Success** | Complete student profiles, coordinated care networks, cases & referrals, automated alerts, two-way SMS, faculty progress reports |
| **Student Engagement Hub** | Student-facing portal with AI knowledge agent, two-way messaging, career matching, sentiment analysis, financial planning, hand-raise feature |
| **Career Services** | Integrates Forage virtual job simulations (Citi, PwC, Goldman Sachs etc.) — students using simulations see 2x interview/offer rates |
| **Advancement CRM** | Alumni engagement, AI-assisted fundraising campaign creation, outcome tracking |

#### AI Capabilities

**Staff-facing AI assistant:**
- Campaign drafting and management
- Data discovery and insights
- Meeting preparation summaries
- Recruitment outreach optimisation

**Student-facing AI navigator:**
- Appointment scheduling with appropriate staff
- Course recommendations aligned with degree progress
- 24/7 response to common questions

**Smart Network:** Proactive engagement monitoring triggering interventions before
challenges escalate.

#### Technical Architecture

- Cloud-based (AWS), web + mobile apps
- System-agnostic with pre-built integrations: Blackboard, Canvas, Brightspace,
  Ellucian, Jenzabar, Moodle, Oracle PeopleSoft, Workday Student, Common App
- Enterprise licensing — no separate user licences, covers all staff and students

**Key insight for Zeus:** Navigate360's enrollment CRM is the system that would
*consume* the kind of targeting intelligence Zeus produces. Its pre-built integrations
list (Ellucian, PeopleSoft, Workday Student) reveals which SIS platforms dominate the
US market. The enterprise licensing model (no per-seat fees) is worth noting — it
removes adoption friction within institutions.

---

### 3. Appily (formerly Cappex) - Student-Facing Lead Generation

**Scale: 3M+ students, 4,000+ college profiles | Multiple acquired brands | Pay-per-lead model — high-margin revenue stream**

Appily launched in September 2023 as EAB's consolidated student-facing platform,
merging several acquisitions into a single destination:

| Brand | Function |
|---|---|
| **Cappex** | College search and matching tools |
| **College Greenlight** | Services for underrepresented and first-generation students |
| **YouVisit** | Immersive virtual campus tours |
| **Concourse** | Reverse admissions platform (now "Appily Match") |

#### Appily Match — Deep Dive (Direct Admissions / Reverse Admissions)

Appily Match is EAB's **reverse admissions platform** — colleges proactively send
admission and scholarship offers to students based on transcript-verified profiles. No
applications required. This is probably the most disruptive product in EAB's portfolio.

**Branding note:** "EAB Match", "Appily Match", and "Enroll360 Match" all refer to the
same product. The branding varies by audience — "Appily Match" for students/counsellors,
"Enroll360 Match" for institutional sales.

##### How Match Works

1. **Students create free, anonymised profiles** (~30 minutes). They share favourite
   classes, hobbies, career aspirations, and grades. No test scores or essays required.
2. **Transcripts are submitted and verified** — school counsellors certify academic
   credentials. This is a key differentiator vs competitors who rely on self-reported data.
3. **Profiles are delivered to partner institutions** based on institutional selection
   criteria. Profiles remain anonymous until students express interest.
4. **Colleges extend real admission + scholarship offers** — typically within 1–2 weeks.
   Institutions can customise offer language, scholarship conditions, and major placements.
5. **Students only see acceptances** — no rejections are communicated, creating a
   positive-only experience.

##### Scale Metrics

- **$14B+** in scholarship offers extended
- **450K+** admission offers made
- **180+** partner colleges/universities
- **6,000+** high schools, districts, and community-based organisations partner with the service
- **72%** of US high school students have access to the platform
- **71%** average admit rate for matched students (2024 entering class)

##### Acquisition & Evolution Timeline

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **2020** | EAB acquires **Cappex** (college search & scholarship platform) |
| **2021 (Feb)** | Hobsons breaks up: PowerSchool acquires Naviance + Intersect for $320M; EAB acquires Starfish for ~$90M and becomes the exclusive provider of Intersect |
| **2021 (Oct)** | EAB and Concourse launch **Greenlight Match** (domestic) and **Global Match** (international) as a pilot in Chicago — ~2,000 admission offers + $135M in scholarships to 650+ students |
| **2022 (Sep)** | EAB **acquires Concourse Global**, the technology platform underlying Match. Expands to Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, Minneapolis/St. Paul, NYC, and Philadelphia |
| **2023** | Cappex rebrands as **Appily**, consolidating Cappex, YouVisit, College Greenlight, and Concourse. Greenlight Match/Global Match rebranded to **"Appily Match"** |
| **2024** | Match integrates with **PowerSchool Naviance**, expanding access to 3M+ high school juniors and seniors across 6,000+ schools |
| **2025 (Jul)** | Alabama launches statewide Direct Admission initiative powered by Appily Match (~40 public/private institutions). Result: $5.1B in scholarships |

##### Naviance Integration (2024) — Key Development

The integration with PowerSchool Naviance is the most significant recent development.
Seniors can now create Appily Match profiles directly within Naviance, giving Match
access to **6M+ students** via the dominant high school counselling platform. No other
direct admission platform has this distribution advantage.

##### Competitive Landscape — Direct Admissions

The direct admissions space grew **85% between 2023–2024** (by number of schools on the
two largest non-state platforms: Common App + EAB Match), with 400K+ students receiving
direct-admit offers for the 2024 entering class. Over 25% of ~20 state programs were
established within the past year.

| Platform | Scale (2025–26) | Key Differentiator |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Appily Match** | 180+ colleges, 450K+ offers, $14B+ scholarships | Transcript-verified profiles; Naviance integration; counsellor involvement |
| **Common App Direct Admissions** | 200+ colleges | Largest application platform; targets first-gen and low/middle-income students; relies on self-reported GPA |
| **Niche Direct Admissions** | 150+ colleges across 35 states | Integrated with Niche's review/ranking platform; pilot began 2022 |
| **College Board (BigFuture)** | Leverages 2M+ SAT test-taker database | Access to standardised test data; massive student reach |
| **State-level programs** | 20+ state programs (many new in past year) | State-backed; several powered by EAB Match technology |

**Match's key advantages:** transcript verification (vs Common App's self-reported GPA),
Naviance distribution (6M+ students), counsellor certification, and customisable offers
within the broader Enroll360 service bundle.

**Match's known weakness:** EAB's own content acknowledges that **direct-admitted
students yield at lower rates** than conventional admits, requiring additional engagement
investment — which conveniently feeds into Enroll360's Yield module.

**Key insight for Zeus:** The direct admissions space is growing rapidly and represents a
fundamental shift in how institutions source students. It's important to recognise this
as a **demand capture** mechanism (students who are already college-bound being matched)
rather than **demand generation** (creating new demand for higher education). Zeus
operates in the demand generation / targeting intelligence layer, which sits upstream.
The state-level adoption trend (Alabama, Idaho, etc.) suggests this will become
infrastructure rather than a differentiator — meaning the real competitive battleground
shifts back to upstream targeting and audience strategy, which is Zeus's domain.

#### How It Works (Student Side)

Appily is **free for students** and positions itself as an all-in-one college planning
tool. Key features:

- **College search** across 4,000+ institutions with filters (major, cost, location,
  GPA/SAT/ACT)
- **Scholarship database** — ~250,000 scholarships totalling ~$50M in value
- **Virtual campus tours** via YouVisit technology
- **Admission chances calculator** based on academic profile
- **Direct Admissions** — the most disruptive feature: participating institutions
  proactively extend admission offers and financial aid to students who complete
  profiles, reversing the traditional application flow ("schools apply to students")

#### How It Works (University Side) — Revenue Model

Appily monetises through several mechanisms, all paid by institutions:

| Revenue Stream | Description |
|---|---|
| **Appily Candidates** | Lead gen using predictive modelling + digital network to connect institutions with qualified prospects likely to apply and enrol |
| **Appily Match** | Direct admissions — students submit transcripts upfront, enabling institutions to verify qualifications before extending offers |
| **Appily Advance** | Lead gen for graduate, healthcare, nursing, and adult-serving programmes |
| **Promotional tools** | Customised visibility across Appily's organic traffic, paid traffic, and partner site network |

#### Performance Metrics

- Students acquired through Appily are **20x more likely to deposit** than traditional
  search names
- Appily Advance costs **~70% less per lead** than Meta, LinkedIn, or paid search
- Appily Advance delivers a **36% higher lead form submission rate** than
  institution-specific paid search
- Appily Match requires **transcript submission upfront**, giving institutions verified
  (not self-reported) academic data — a significant quality differentiator vs competitors

#### Competitive Position Among Student-Search Platforms

Appily competes in a crowded US student-search market. Key competitors include:

| Competitor | Differentiator vs Appily |
|---|---|
| **[Niche](https://www.niche.com/)** | User-generated reviews & ratings; ~$10K/yr avg subscription; leads 15x more likely to apply, 24x to enrol |
| **[BigFuture](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/)** (College Board) | Direct pipeline from SAT scores — massive captive audience |
| **[Common App](https://www.commonapp.org/)** | Dominant application portal (1,000+ institutions, 3M+ users/year) — not search-focused but owns the application step |
| **[Naviance](https://www.naviance.com/)** (PowerSchool) | Embedded in high school counselling workflows — institutional rather than student-driven |
| **[College Raptor](https://www.collegeraptor.com/)** | Personalised financial aid estimates + acceptance odds |

Appily's moat is the **combination of search + matching + direct admissions + virtual
tours** in a single platform, backed by EAB's institutional relationships via Enroll360.
No single competitor offers this full stack.

> See [Student Search Platforms](/docs/insights/student-search-platforms.md) for a full
> analysis of USA and Australian student-search platforms.

**Key insight for Zeus:** Appily gives EAB a proprietary first-party data asset
(student intent signals) at massive scale (3M+ students). This is a significant
competitive moat that would be difficult to replicate. The Direct Admissions model
is particularly disruptive — it positions EAB as the marketplace connecting supply
(institutions) and demand (students). Zeus should focus on public/open data sources as
a differentiator, and recognise that Appily represents a **demand capture** channel
that sits downstream of the **demand generation** work Zeus supports.

### 4. Adult Learner Recruitment

**Scale: 200+ partner institutions | 6:1 average ROI | 18% average graduate enrolment growth**

A dedicated full-funnel solution for graduate, online, and adult learner enrolment —
positioned as an alternative to traditional OPMs (Online Program Managers) or digital
agencies.

#### Performance Claims

- **6:1** average ROI for graduate programs across multi-year partnerships
- **18%** average graduate enrolment growth
- Conversation Agent handles **75%** of student questions outside business hours

#### The 4 C's Framework

| Stage | Description |
|---|---|
| **Curate** | Expands student pools via proprietary database of **200M+ consumers**, Appily Advance, and AI chat agent. Refines known lead sources (organic traffic, paid search, test-taker lists) |
| **Cultivate** | Responsive, multi-channel campaigns with hyper-personalised messaging adapted to individual student goals and engagement patterns |
| **Convert** | 24/7 campaign performance data via Partner Portal. Intent surveys, financial aid modelling, and yield optimisation post-admission |
| **Strategize** | Fee-for-service strategic guidance on program design, pricing, market positioning, corporate partnerships, and org structure |

#### Service Model

Each partner works with a dedicated **Strategic Leader** who becomes an extension of
the institution's leadership team — similar to the Enroll360 model but specialised for
the adult/graduate segment.

**Key insight for Zeus:** The adult/postgrad segment is a distinct market with different
targeting needs. EAB's "200M+ consumer database" for prospect identification is a major
proprietary asset. Zeus's job market (IVI) and career outcome data assets are directly
relevant to the "Curate" stage — particularly for identifying career-switcher audiences.
The "Strategize" tier (program design, pricing, market positioning) is a consulting
revenue stream Zeus could also explore.

### 5. Edify - Data & Analytics Platform

**Scale: 250+ partner institutions | 3x faster deployment than traditional DW | 50% faster report building**

Edify is an AI-powered, cloud-native data management platform (hosted on AWS).

#### Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Data Lake/Warehouse** | Cloud-native, vendor-agnostic ingestion via pre-built higher-ed connectors or custom extractions. Downstream data delivery, snapshotting, permissions management |
| **Data Governance** | Higher-ed-specific data model with **200+ out-of-the-box data/metadata definitions**, data catalogue, and lineage tracking |
| **Self-Service Analytics** | No/low-code data exploration and operational reporting |
| **Accelerators** | **50+ pre-built reports and dashboards** across 10 functional areas. Customisable analytic workspaces for priorities like course planning |
| **BI Integration** | Connects to preferred business intelligence tools for visualisation |
| **Predictive Modelling** | Self-service predictive modelling capabilities |

#### AI Features (Edify AI)

Three embedded AI agents:

| Agent | Function |
|---|---|
| **Query Assist** | Converts natural language prompts into executable SQL to retrieve data and create reports |
| **Data Search Assist** | Locates data using plain-language queries across the data catalogue |
| **SQL Explainer** | Translates SQL into human-readable explanations |

#### Implementation & Services

- Core platform deployed in **~10 days**
- Source system integrations in **~2 weeks**
- Customisable professional service hours for: integration services, data science &
  analysis, process consulting, strategy & culture support

**Key insight for Zeus:** Edify has **250+ partners** (more than initially estimated)
and is a growing product. Its higher-ed-specific data model with 200+ pre-built
definitions represents significant domain IP. If Zeus outputs could plug into platforms
like Edify (or similar institutional data warehouses), it would increase adoption. The
"Accelerators" concept (pre-built dashboards for specific use cases) is a packaging
model Zeus could adopt for its own insights.

and steers teams to the right resources — same service model pattern as Enroll360 and
Adult Learner Recruitment.
