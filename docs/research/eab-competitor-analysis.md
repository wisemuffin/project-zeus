> **Last updated:** 2026-02-18

> benchmark for university digital marketing and student acquisition.

## Company Overview

EAB (formerly the Education Advisory Board) is a technology, research, and services
company that partners with higher education institutions to improve enrolment, student
success, and institutional outcomes. They serve **2,500+ institutions** and **10M+
students** across their platforms.

EAB was originally part of The Advisory Board Company, which split its education
division into a standalone entity. The company is now privately held (acquired by Vista
Equity Partners). Estimated total revenue is **~$175M–$214M** annually (unverified —
no public filings available). Product-level revenue is not disclosed.

## Product Offerings — Scale Indicators

> **Note:** EAB is privately held and does not publish product-level revenue. The scale
> indicators below (institutional reach, partner counts) are the best available proxies
> for relative product weighting.

### 1. Enroll360 - Enrollment Marketing & Recruitment

**Scale: 1,100+ partner schools | Likely largest revenue contributor (marketing + lead gen fees)**

**Directly competes with Project Zeus's targeting use case.**

Enroll360 is EAB's full-funnel enrolment marketing solution that combines marketing
campaigns with proprietary recruitment platforms.

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **Audience Strategy** | Data-driven audience identification using proprietary and third-party data to find right-fit students |
| **Marketing Campaigns** | Responsive digital campaigns (paid media, SEO, retargeting, email) to build affinity over time |
| **Cultivate Campaigns** | Inquiry-generation campaigns — students who inquire through Cultivate are reportedly **6.3x more likely to enrol** vs traditional methods |
| **Funnel Analytics** | Performance tracking across the full recruitment funnel |

Enroll360 is trusted by **1,100+ schools** for recruitment marketing.

**Key insight for Zeus:** Enroll360 bundles data-driven audience targeting with campaign
execution. Project Zeus focuses on the upstream research/targeting layer — we need to
be clearer and more granular than EAB's audience strategy to differentiate.

### 2. Navigate360 - CRM & Student Success Platform

**Scale: 850+ institutions, 10M+ students | Core SaaS platform — likely second-largest revenue line**

Navigate360 is the leading higher-education CRM, used by **850+ institutions**. It
covers the full student lifecycle from recruitment through to alumni engagement.

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| **Enrollment CRM** | Prospect management, application tracking, AI-driven engagement prioritisation |
| **Student Success** | Early-alert systems, advisor tools, intervention workflows |
| **Career Services** | Career pathway matching, employer engagement |
| **Alumni & Advancement** | Donor cultivation, alumni engagement tracking |

Partners report **3-15% graduation rate increases** and a typical **5:1 ROI**.

**Key insight for Zeus:** Navigate360's enrollment CRM is the system that would
*consume* the kind of targeting intelligence Zeus produces. Understanding its data model
and integration points could inform how we package our outputs.

### 3. Appily (formerly Cappex) - Student-Facing Lead Generation

**Scale: 3M+ students, 4,000+ college profiles | Multiple acquired brands | Pay-per-lead model — high-margin revenue stream**

Appily launched in September 2023 as EAB's consolidated student-facing platform,
merging several acquisitions into a single destination:

| Brand | Function |
|---|---|
| **Cappex** | College search and matching tools |
| **College Greenlight** | Services for underrepresented and first-generation students |
| **YouVisit** | Immersive virtual campus tours |
| **Concourse** | Reverse admissions platform (now "Appily Match") |

#### How It Works (Student Side)

Appily is **free for students** and positions itself as an all-in-one college planning
tool. Key features:

- **College search** across 4,000+ institutions with filters (major, cost, location,
  GPA/SAT/ACT)
- **Scholarship database** — ~250,000 scholarships totalling ~$50M in value
- **Virtual campus tours** via YouVisit technology
- **Admission chances calculator** based on academic profile
- **Direct Admissions** — the most disruptive feature: participating institutions
  proactively extend admission offers and financial aid to students who complete
  profiles, reversing the traditional application flow ("schools apply to students")

#### How It Works (University Side) — Revenue Model

Appily monetises through several mechanisms, all paid by institutions:

| Revenue Stream | Description |
|---|---|
| **Appily Candidates** | Lead gen using predictive modelling + digital network to connect institutions with qualified prospects likely to apply and enrol |
| **Appily Match** | Direct admissions — students submit transcripts upfront, enabling institutions to verify qualifications before extending offers |
| **Appily Advance** | Lead gen for graduate, healthcare, nursing, and adult-serving programmes |
| **Promotional tools** | Customised visibility across Appily's organic traffic, paid traffic, and partner site network |

#### Performance Metrics

- Students acquired through Appily are **20x more likely to deposit** than traditional
  search names
- Appily Advance costs **~70% less per lead** than Meta, LinkedIn, or paid search
- Appily Advance delivers a **36% higher lead form submission rate** than
  institution-specific paid search
- Appily Match requires **transcript submission upfront**, giving institutions verified
  (not self-reported) academic data — a significant quality differentiator vs competitors

#### Competitive Position Among Student-Search Platforms

Appily competes in a crowded US student-search market. Key competitors include:

| Competitor | Differentiator vs Appily |
|---|---|
| **[Niche](https://www.niche.com/)** | User-generated reviews & ratings; ~$10K/yr avg subscription; leads 15x more likely to apply, 24x to enrol |
| **[BigFuture](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/)** (College Board) | Direct pipeline from SAT scores — massive captive audience |
| **[Common App](https://www.commonapp.org/)** | Dominant application portal (1,000+ institutions, 3M+ users/year) — not search-focused but owns the application step |
| **[Naviance](https://www.naviance.com/)** (PowerSchool) | Embedded in high school counselling workflows — institutional rather than student-driven |
| **[College Raptor](https://www.collegeraptor.com/)** | Personalised financial aid estimates + acceptance odds |

Appily's moat is the **combination of search + matching + direct admissions + virtual
tours** in a single platform, backed by EAB's institutional relationships via Enroll360.
No single competitor offers this full stack.

> See [Student Search Platforms](/docs/insights/student-search-platforms.md) for a full
> analysis of USA and Australian student-search platforms.

**Key insight for Zeus:** Appily gives EAB a proprietary first-party data asset
(student intent signals) at massive scale (3M+ students). This is a significant
competitive moat that would be difficult to replicate. The Direct Admissions model
is particularly disruptive — it positions EAB as the marketplace connecting supply
(institutions) and demand (students). Zeus should focus on public/open data sources as
a differentiator, and recognise that Appily represents a **demand capture** channel
that sits downstream of the **demand generation** work Zeus supports.

### 4. Adult Learner Recruitment

**Scale: 480+ graduate marketing & enrollment partners | 12+ years in segment — feeds into Enroll360 revenue**

A dedicated solution for graduate, online, and adult learner enrolment growth.

- Uses consumer analytics, paid media, SEO, retargeting, and proprietary data sources
  to identify prospective adult learners
- Gamified web experiences to match students to personalised career pathways
- Backed by **12+ years** of experience in the adult learner segment

**Key insight for Zeus:** The adult/postgrad segment is a distinct market with different
targeting needs. Zeus's job market (IVI) and career outcome data assets are directly
relevant here.

### 5. Edify - Data & Analytics Platform

**Scale: Undisclosed partner count | Newer product — likely smaller but growing revenue line (SaaS model)**

Edify is an AI-powered, cloud-native data management platform (hosted on AWS).

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Data Lake/Warehouse** | Vendor-agnostic ingestion via pre-built higher-ed connectors or custom extractions |
| **Self-Service Analytics** | No/low-code data exploration, analysis, and operational reporting |
| **Accelerators** | Pre-built analytic workspaces for strategic priorities (e.g., course planning) |
| **AI Features** | Query Assist (natural language to SQL), Data Search Assist, Query Explainer |
| **BI Integration** | Connects to preferred business intelligence tools for visualisation |

Implementation timeline: core platform in **~10 days**, source system integrations in
**~2 weeks**.

**Key insight for Zeus:** Edify shows EAB investing in self-service analytics. If Zeus
outputs could plug into platforms like Edify (or similar institutional data warehouses),
it would increase adoption.

---

### 6. Strategic Advisory Services

**Scale: 2,500+ member institutions | Subscription/membership model — legacy revenue base that underpins all other products**

EAB maintains a large research and advisory practice:

- **Research forums** covering enrolment, advancement, academic affairs, and
  institutional strategy
- **Subject matter experts** available for consulting on critical institutional issues
- **Advancement Advisory Services** focused on fundraising, alumni engagement, and
  donor cultivation
- **Roundtables** — executive-level gatherings for advancement and enrolment leaders
