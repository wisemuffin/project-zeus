# Squiz DXP - Australian University CMS Market Research

> **Last updated:** 2026-02-25
> **Relevance to Project Zeus:** Squiz is the dominant CMS/DXP used by Australian
> universities. Understanding their platform capabilities and market penetration helps
> Zeus package recommendations in a format that is directly actionable for university
> marketing teams.

## Company Overview

Squiz is an Australian-founded Digital Experience Platform (DXP) company headquartered
in Sydney. Their platform combines content management (Squiz Matrix), enterprise search
(Funnelback, originally developed by ANU/CSIRO), personalization, analytics, and forms
into a single SaaS offering.

Squiz claims that **over half of Australian and New Zealand universities** use their
platform — roughly 22+ of Australia's ~43 universities.

## Platform Capabilities

### Content Management (Squiz Matrix)

- Visual Page Builder with drag-and-drop components (no-code)
- 1,000+ content authors supported at scale (University of Melbourne)
- Design system support for consistent branding across faculties
- Multi-site management (Monash runs 125+ internet/intranet sites)

### Personalization & Testing

- **A/B testing** — trial messaging, layouts, and CTAs using real data
- **Personalized content delivery** — tailor pages based on visitor attributes
- **Course finder tools** — interactive search for prospective students

### Search (Funnelback)

- Enterprise search across university content
- Originally developed by ANU and CSIRO, now part of Squiz DXP
- Used for both public site search and internal knowledge discovery

### Analytics & Forms

- Built-in analytics for content performance
- Form builder for lead capture and enquiries
- Integrates with CRM, SIS, and email platforms

## Relevance to Project Zeus

Squiz is the **execution layer** where university marketing teams act on targeting
decisions. Zeus is the **intelligence layer** that informs those decisions. They are
complementary:

| Zeus Output | Squiz Capability | Actionable Integration |
|---|---|---|
| **Who** — demographic segments with unmet demand | Personalization engine | Personalize landing pages by age/gender segment |
| **Where** — high-opportunity LGAs and states | A/B testing | Test geo-targeted messaging for specific regions |
| **What message** — field-of-study demand, career outcomes | Content management | Create field-specific landing pages with outcome proof points |
| Opportunity gap fields | Course finder | Promote high-gap courses more prominently |
| Trending interests | A/B testing | Test timely messaging hooks identified from Google Trends |

**Key insight:** Zeus doesn't need to integrate with Squiz technically. The value is in
packaging Zeus's recommendations so they map to actions a Squiz user can take — e.g.,
"create a personalized landing page for 25–34yo women in Western Sydney interested in
nursing" is directly executable in Squiz's Visual Page Builder + personalization engine.

## Australian University Adoption

### Likely (additional universities — indirect evidence)

Listed on cmsedu.com or referenced in Squiz partner LinkedIn profiles:

- RMIT University (VIC)
- Swinburne University of Technology (VIC)
- Victoria University (VIC)
- University of Canberra (ACT)
- University of Western Australia (WA)
- Edith Cowan University (WA)
- Curtin University (WA)

### Known Non-Squiz

| University | CMS | Source |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| Charles Darwin University | Drupal 8 | PreviousNext case study (2017–2018) |

### Geographic Distribution (Confirmed)

| State | Count | Universities |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| VIC | 4 | Melbourne, Monash, Deakin, La Trobe |
| NSW | 4 | Macquarie, Newcastle, Western Sydney, UNE |
| QLD | 4 | Griffith, UniSC, JCU, QUT |
| TAS | 1 | University of Tasmania |
| WA | 1 | Notre Dame Australia |
| SA | 1 | University of South Australia |

**Notable:** Strong coverage in VIC, NSW, and QLD — the three largest states for
student populations. If "likely" universities are included, WA coverage also becomes
substantial (Curtin, Murdoch, Edith Cowan, UWA).

## Key Squiz Implementation Partners

Several agencies specialise in Squiz deployments for Australian universities:

| Partner | University Clients |
|---------|--------------------|
| **FrontStage Digital** | Notre Dame, La Trobe, Melbourne, Monash |
| **Deepend Group** | Official Squiz partner, education sector |
| **Ladoo** | Deakin University |
| **Polished Pixels** | Macquarie University |
| **Brainium Labs** | NT and national education institutions |

## Implications for Project Zeus

### What this means

1. **Squiz is the default CMS for our target market.** When Zeus recommends a
   university "create a landing page for [segment] highlighting [career outcome]",
   the marketing team will build that page in Squiz. Recommendations should be
   phrased in terms of Squiz-executable actions.

2. **Personalization is available but underused.** Squiz offers A/B testing and
   personalization, but most universities primarily use it as a basic CMS. Zeus's
   segment-specific recommendations could help universities unlock features they
   already pay for.

3. **Course finder is a key touchpoint.** Squiz's interactive course finder is
   often the highest-traffic prospective student page. Zeus's opportunity gap and
   field value proposition data could inform how courses are presented and promoted
   within these tools.

4. **The partner ecosystem matters.** FrontStage, Deepend, and other agencies are
   the ones who implement Zeus's recommendations in practice. They are potential
   channel partners or referral sources.

### What this does NOT mean

- **No technical integration needed.** Zeus provides research and recommendations,
  not CMS plugins. The value is in the intelligence, not in piping data into Squiz.
- **No data source here.** Squiz is a CMS, not a data source for market research.
- **No change to the data pipeline.** The core analytical work (demographics,
  geographic signals, field-of-study demand) is unchanged.
