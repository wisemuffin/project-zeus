# Student Search & Matching Platforms

> How do prospective students discover universities, and how can institutions intercept that journey?

**Context:** Understanding the platforms students use to search for courses and universities is critical for digital marketing strategy. These platforms represent high-intent touchpoints where prospective students are actively in decision-making mode.

## USA Market

### Appily (formerly Cappex) — The Market Leader

**Owner:** EAB (Education Advisory Board)
**URL:** [appily.com](https://www.appily.com/)
**Scale:** 3M+ students, 4,000+ college profiles

Appily is an all-in-one college planning platform that consolidated several EAB acquisitions (Cappex, YouVisit, College Greenlight, Concourse) into a single destination launched September 2023.

**Key features:**
- College search with filters (major, cost, location, GPA/SAT/ACT)
- Scholarship database (~250,000 scholarships, ~$50M total value)
- Virtual campus tours (via YouVisit tech)
- Admission chances calculator
- **Direct Admissions** — schools can proactively extend admission offers to students who complete profiles, reversing the traditional application flow

**Business model (for universities):**
- Pay-per-lead / candidate acquisition — universities purchase qualified student leads
- Appily Advance (graduate/adult programs) costs ~70% less per lead than Meta/LinkedIn/paid search
- Appily Match requires students to submit transcripts upfront, giving institutions verified qualifications
- Students acquired through Appily are **20x more likely to deposit** than traditional search names
- Custom pricing via consultation (no public rate card)

**Marketing relevance:** Appily is essentially a **demand capture** channel — students are already searching. Universities pay to be visible and to receive warm leads. The Direct Admissions feature is particularly disruptive: it flips the funnel so institutions apply to students.

## Australia Market

The Australian landscape is structurally different — the Tertiary Admission Centres (TACs) play a centralised role that doesn't exist in the US. There is no single dominant "Appily equivalent" but rather a mix of government, semi-government, and commercial platforms.

### Government / Semi-Government Platforms

| Platform | Owner | Role |
|----------|-------|------|
| **[CourseSeeker](https://www.courseseeker.edu.au/)** | Australian Government (Dept of Education) | National course search for 3,000+ undergraduate & postgraduate courses |
| **[ComparED / QILT](https://www.compared.edu.au/)** | Australian Government | Compare student experience, satisfaction, and graduate employment outcomes across institutions |
| **[Study Assist](https://www.studyassist.gov.au/)** | Australian Government | HECS-HELP information + course comparison |
| **[UAC](https://www.uac.edu.au/)** (Universities Admissions Centre) | NSW/ACT consortium | Course search + centralised applications for NSW/ACT |
| **[QTAC](https://www.qtac.edu.au/)** | QLD consortium | Course search + applications for QLD/Northern NSW (1,800+ courses) |
| **VTAC, SATAC, TISC** | State consortia | Equivalent TACs for VIC, SA, WA respectively |

### Commercial Platforms

| Platform | Model | Focus |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **[Good Universities Guide](https://www.gooduniversitiesguide.com.au/)** | Lead gen + advertising | Course comparison, institution profiles, direct enquiry links |
| **[StudySelect](https://studyselect.com.au/)** | Commission per lead | Markets courses from universities, TAFEs, and colleges; earns commission per prospective student referral |
| **[CourseFinder](https://www.coursefinder.com.au/)** | Lead gen / ad-supported | 500+ online courses from Australian universities and TAFEs |
| **[Hotcourses / IDP](https://www.hotcoursesabroad.com/)** | Part of IDP Education | Strong in international student recruitment; partnerships with 500+ universities globally |

## Key Differences: USA vs Australia

| Dimension | USA | Australia |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| **Market structure** | Fragmented, competitive, heavily commercialised | Centralised via TACs + government portals |
| **Lead gen maturity** | Highly mature — Appily, Niche sell verified leads at scale | Less mature — Good Universities Guide and StudySelect are closest equivalents |
| **Direct admissions** | Appily pioneered "schools apply to students" | Not established; TAC-based application is the norm |
| **Data richness** | SAT/ACT scores, GPA, transcripts feed matching algorithms | ATAR-based, but less commercial data exchange |
| **International recruitment** | Separate ecosystem (agents, EducationUSA) | IDP/Hotcourses/Adventus.io are major players |
| **Cost transparency** | Niche avg ~$10K/yr subscription; Appily custom pricing | Less publicly documented pricing |

## Marketing Implications for Universities

### Demand Capture Strategy
These platforms represent **bottom-of-funnel** touchpoints — students are actively searching. Universities should:
1. **Ensure presence** on the dominant platforms in their target market
2. **Optimise profiles** with compelling content, virtual tours, and clear value propositions
3. **Purchase leads** strategically from high-conversion platforms (Appily leads are 20x more likely to deposit)

### Platform Selection by Objective
| Objective | USA Platform | AUS Platform |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Broad domestic reach | Appily, Niche, BigFuture | CourseSeeker, Good Universities Guide |
| High-intent leads | Appily Match (transcript-verified) | StudySelect, Good Universities Guide |
| Peer influence / social proof | Niche (reviews), Unibuddy | University Reviews, Unibuddy |
| International students | Separate channels | IDP/Hotcourses, Adventus.io |
| Application pipeline | Common App, Coalition | UAC, QTAC, VTAC (state TACs) |

### Where Project Zeus Fits
Understanding which platforms students use helps us:
- **Target ads** to audiences who are also active on these platforms (lookalike audiences)
- **Benchmark messaging** — what information are students searching for? (cost, outcomes, location)
- **Identify gaps** — if a university is underrepresented on high-traffic platforms, that's a quick win
- **Inform content strategy** — trending search terms on these platforms signal what messaging resonates
