# Historical Demand Trends

> Are applicant volumes growing or declining, and which segments are driving the change?

**Source models:** `historical_demand_trends`, `stg_uac_demand_by_year`
**Data sources:** UAC Early Bird closing applicant counts (2016-17 to 2025-26)

## Summary

UAC Early Bird applications have rebounded strongly after a post-COVID decline. Total applications reached 68,652 in 2025-26 (+6.4% YoY), approaching the COVID-era peak of 69,602 in 2020-21. However, the growth is uneven across segments.

| Segment | Latest Count | YoY Growth | Peak | Recovery Ratio | CAGR (10yr) | Direction |
|---------|-------------:|-----------:|-----:|---------------:|------------:|-----------|
| Total | 68,652 | **+6.4%** | 69,602 | 98.6% | +0.1% | Growing |
| NSW Year 12 | 41,946 | **+5.2%** | 42,339 | 99.1% | -0.1% | Growing |
| Non-Year 12 | 18,830 | **+9.6%** | 21,661 | 86.9% | +0.1% | Growing |
| Interstate & IB | 6,159 | **+7.5%** | 6,159 | 100% (new peak) | +3.1% | Growing |
| ACT Year 12 | 1,717 | **-1.9%** | 2,306 | 74.5% | -3.2% | Declining |

## Key Findings

### 1. The market is in a strong recovery cycle

Total applications have grown for two consecutive years (+2.7% then +6.4%), recovering from a trough of 62,846 in 2023-24. The market is now at 98.6% of its 2020-21 peak. This suggests the overall addressable market for university student acquisition is expanding.

**Budget implication:** This is a good time to invest in acquisition — the applicant pool is growing, not shrinking.

### 2. Non-Year 12 is the fastest-growing segment but furthest from peak

Mature-age applicants grew 9.6% YoY — the fastest of any segment — but remain 13.1% below their COVID-era peak (21,661 in 2020-21). The COVID spike was likely driven by career-changers during lockdowns. The current recovery suggests sustained structural demand from mature learners.

**Marketing angle:** Career-change messaging is working. This segment responds to economic uncertainty and career outcomes data. Double down on mature-age campaigns, especially for Health (mature learner index 1.30) and IT (1.24).

### 3. Interstate & IB is at an all-time high

At 6,159 applicants, Interstate & IB Year 12 has hit a new peak — up 7.5% YoY with a 3.1% CAGR over 10 years. NSW/ACT universities are increasingly attracting students from other states.

**Marketing angle:** National reach campaigns are paying off. Fields with high interstate draw ratios (Health 1.59, Natural Sciences 1.67, Engineering 1.24) should receive increased interstate ad spend.

### 4. NSW Year 12 is recovering to near-peak levels

NSW Year 12 applications (41,946) are back to 99.1% of their 2016-17 peak after several years of decline. The +5.2% YoY growth is the strongest in this segment since the COVID bounce.

**Marketing angle:** The core domestic school leaver market is healthy. Maintain investment in NSW-focused Year 12 campaigns.

### 5. ACT Year 12 is in structural decline

ACT is the only declining segment (-1.9% YoY) with a -3.2% CAGR and only 74.5% peak recovery. This is a 10-year trend, not a blip. Despite ACT having the highest demand density in the state demand index (102.8 grad vacancies per 1k youth), students are applying elsewhere.

**Marketing angle:** ACT is high-demand but shrinking applicant pool. Consider whether the cost of acquisition in ACT justifies the declining volume, or reallocate to the growing interstate segment.

## Limitations

- UAC data covers NSW/ACT-based university applications only — not a national picture
- Early Bird closing counts are a leading indicator but not final enrolment figures
- No field-of-study breakdown in the historical data — we can only see segment-level trends, not whether Health or IT applications are growing specifically
- The COVID period (2019-21) created unusual spikes that distort trend analysis
