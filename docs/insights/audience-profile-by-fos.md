# Audience Profile by Field of Study

> Who should we target for each field of study, and where are they?

**Source models:** `audience_profile_by_fos`, `stg_uac_fos_by_app_type`, `stg_uac_fos_by_gender`
**Data sources:** UAC Early Bird first preferences by applicant type and gender

## Summary

Each field of study attracts a distinct audience profile across three dimensions: gender, age (Year 12 school leavers vs mature-age Non-Year 12), and geographic origin (NSW-local vs interstate). These profiles inform ad creative, audience targeting, and campaign geography.

| Field | Gender Skew | Mature Index | Interstate Draw | Opportunity Rank |
|-------|-------------|-------------:|----------------:|-----------------:|
| Health | Female | **1.30** | **1.59** | 1 |
| Information Technology | Male | **1.24** | 0.47 | 2 |
| Management & Commerce | Male | 0.89 | 0.74 | 3 |
| Education | Female | 0.93 | 0.11 | 4 |
| Architecture & Building | Male | 0.75 | 0.33 | 5 |
| Engineering | Male | 0.79 | **1.24** | 6 |
| Creative Arts | Female | 0.97 | 0.42 | 7 |
| Society & Culture | Female | 0.86 | 0.81 | 8 |
| Natural & Physical Sciences | Female (marginal) | 0.87 | **1.67** | 9 |

**Mature Learner Index:** Non-Year 12 preference share / Total preference share. Above 1.0 = over-indexes with mature-age applicants.
**Interstate Draw Ratio:** Interstate & IB preference share / NSW preference share. Above 1.0 = draws disproportionately from interstate.

## Key Findings

### 1. Health attracts mature learners AND interstate students

Health is the top opportunity gap field (+10.2pp) and has the strongest mature learner index (1.30) — Non-Year 12 applicants prefer health at 34.5% vs 26.6% overall. It also has the highest interstate draw ratio (1.59), meaning interstate students prefer health significantly more than NSW locals.

**Targeting:** Run two parallel campaigns — (a) career-changers/mature-age on Facebook/Instagram emphasising health career growth, (b) interstate school leavers on broader national reach.

### 2. IT attracts mature learners but is hyper-local

IT has a high mature learner index (1.24) but very low interstate draw (0.47). Interstate students show almost no interest (1.5% share). IT interest is concentrated among NSW and ACT applicants.

**Targeting:** Focus spend on NSW/ACT geographies. Mature-age messaging (career change into tech) could be effective given the high mature learner index.

### 3. Education is the most geographically local field

Education has the lowest interstate draw ratio (0.11) — virtually zero interstate interest. It's overwhelmingly an NSW/ACT local choice, driven by female school leavers.

**Targeting:** Hyperlocal NSW/ACT campaigns only. Don't waste spend on national reach for education degrees.

### 4. Engineering and Natural Sciences draw from interstate

Engineering (1.24) and Natural & Physical Sciences (1.67) both draw disproportionately from interstate students. These fields justify national campaign reach.

**Targeting:** National campaigns for engineering and sciences, not just NSW/ACT focused.

### 5. Management & Commerce skews young

Management & Commerce has a below-average mature learner index (0.89), meaning it's primarily a school leaver choice. Combined with its male skew, the profile is young males — the most digitally reachable demographic.

**Targeting:** Instagram/TikTok campaigns aimed at male Year 12 students with career outcomes messaging (3rd-largest opportunity gap at +4.4pp).

### 6. Architecture & Building has the strongest youth skew

With the lowest mature learner index (0.75) and very low interstate draw (0.33), Architecture appeals specifically to local male school leavers. It's not a career-change field.

**Targeting:** Narrow audience — NSW/ACT male Year 12 students only. Small but well-defined.

## Audience Segment Summary

| Segment | Top Fields | Campaign Type |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Female mature-age career changers | Health, IT | Facebook/Instagram, career change messaging |
| Male school leavers (NSW/ACT) | IT, Management & Commerce, Architecture | Instagram/TikTok, career outcomes |
| Female school leavers (NSW/ACT) | Health, Education, Society & Culture | Instagram, career stability messaging |
| Interstate school leavers | Health, Engineering, Natural Sciences | National reach campaigns |

## Limitations

- No direct FOS × age cross-tabulation exists — the mature learner index is a proxy based on Non-Year 12 preference over-indexing
- UAC data covers NSW/ACT applicants only — interstate applicants are those applying to NSW/ACT universities from other states, not a national picture
- Fields with zero or near-zero preference shares (Food & Hospitality, Mixed Field Programs) produce null or unreliable ratios
