# State Demand Index

> Where is graduate job demand strongest relative to the youth population?

**Source models:** `state_demand_index`, `stg_job_vacancies_by_state`, `stg_youth_population_by_state`
**Data sources:** IVI job vacancies (Jobs and Skills Australia), ABS Estimated Resident Population 15-19 year olds by LGA

## Summary

The state demand index measures graduate-level job vacancies (ANZSCO skill levels 1-2: bachelor degree or diploma) per 1,000 youth aged 15-19. Higher values indicate states where graduate job demand outpaces the local youth talent pipeline — priority geographies for university marketing spend.

| Rank | State | Grad Vacancies per 1k Youth | Graduate Vacancies | Youth Pop (15-19) | Grad Share | Grad Growth (12m) |
|------|-------|----------------------------:|-------------------:|------------------:|-----------:|------------------:|
| 1 | ACT | **102.8** | 2,801 | 27,251 | 60.5% | -16.0% |
| 2 | NT | **87.4** | 1,400 | 16,020 | 49.1% | -9.0% |
| 3 | WA | **64.9** | 11,766 | 181,423 | 43.5% | +0.8% |
| 4 | NSW | **63.6** | 32,733 | 514,760 | 50.2% | +2.0% |
| 5 | QLD | **63.0** | 22,732 | 361,058 | 43.1% | -0.4% |
| 6 | SA | **59.9** | 6,642 | 110,954 | 46.3% | +2.5% |
| 7 | VIC | **57.1** | 23,795 | 416,787 | 51.3% | -0.6% |
| 8 | TAS | **48.4** | 1,634 | 33,763 | 48.2% | -4.7% |

## Key Findings

### 1. ACT has the highest demand density but is contracting

ACT leads with 102.8 graduate vacancies per 1,000 youth — nearly double the national average. It also has the highest graduate share (60.5% of all vacancies are degree-level), driven by the public service. However, graduate vacancies fell 16.0% year-on-year, suggesting a cooling Canberra market.

**Marketing angle:** Target ACT with public policy, government, and professional degree programs. Caveat: monitor for continued contraction.

### 2. NT is an underserved market

NT ranks second at 87.4 per 1,000 youth. The small absolute numbers (1,400 graduate vacancies, 16,020 youth) limit scale, but the high ratio signals unmet demand — especially for health and education professionals in remote areas.

**Marketing angle:** Remote/regional placement messaging for health and education degrees.

### 3. The big three (NSW, QLD, WA) are the volume play

NSW, QLD, and WA have similar demand densities (63-65 per 1k youth) but massive absolute markets. NSW alone has 32,733 graduate vacancies. WA and NSW are both growing (WA +0.8%, NSW +2.0%), making them stable targets for spend.

**Marketing angle:** These states offer both scale and stability — bread-and-butter markets for acquisition campaigns.

### 4. VIC has the lowest demand density among mainland states

At 57.1 per 1,000 youth, VIC is 11% below NSW despite having the second-highest graduate share (51.3%). The market is also slightly contracting (-0.6%). VIC's large university sector means more competition for the same students.

**Marketing angle:** VIC requires sharper differentiation — career outcomes messaging may cut through in a competitive market.

### 5. SA is growing and underserved

SA has the strongest graduate vacancy growth (+2.5%) among states with meaningful volume. At 59.9 per 1k youth, it sits below the big three but is trending upward.

**Marketing angle:** Growth narrative — "SA's graduate job market is expanding faster than any other state."

### 6. TAS has the weakest demand signal

The lowest demand density (48.4) and contracting graduate vacancies (-4.7%) make TAS the least attractive state for career-outcomes-based marketing.

## Methodology Notes

- **Graduate-level** = ANZSCO skill levels 1 (bachelor degree or higher) and 2 (advanced diploma/diploma)
- **Youth population** = ABS Estimated Resident Population aged 15-19, latest available year (2024), aggregated from LGA to state using the ABS LGA 2024 coding scheme (first digit = state)
- **Vacancy data** = IVI (Internet Vacancy Index) latest available month, state-level totals
- ACT and NT have small absolute numbers, so per-capita rankings should be interpreted cautiously
