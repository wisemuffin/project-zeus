# Project Zeus — 1-Minute Pitch

> **Last updated:** 2026-02-25

Imagine a university promoting a science degree to thousands of prospective students — while across the street, employers are desperate for health and IT graduates they can't find. This is happening right now, across the country, because the data universities need to make smart marketing decisions is scattered across half a dozen government datasets that no marketing team has the time or tools to combine.

The pressure has never been greater. International student caps are stripping **$600 million** from university revenue — funding that supported staff, research, and the student experience. Domestic participation is at decade lows. And under the new Universities Accord, institutions that don't fill their funded places face real-terms funding cuts. Universities must recruit smarter — but the alternatives are expensive consulting engagements or US-focused platforms that don't cover Australian data.

**Project Zeus** changes this. Our platform combines job vacancy data, admissions preferences, and graduate outcomes into actionable targeting intelligence. It answers three critical questions: **Who** to target. **Where** to target. And **what message** will resonate.

The platform is built and operational today — 8 analysis models, 6 interactive dashboards, automated pipelines refreshed from authoritative public sources. Transparent methodology. A fraction of the cost of consulting.

We're starting with mid-tier Australian universities — the institutions under the most pressure, without the internal data teams to do this themselves. From there, we scale to **200+ higher education providers**, marketing agencies, and international markets.

Universities don't need to spend more on marketing. They need to spend smarter. **We're here to make that possible — and we're looking for pilot partners ready to lead the way.**
