## 1. Platform Overviews

### School Bytes (now a Compass company)

School Bytes is a school administration SaaS platform built specifically for **NSW public schools**. It offers subscription-based modular software covering student administration, finance, and parent engagement.

Compass itself is backed by [EQT, a major European private equity firm](https://eqtgroup.com/thinq/case-study/compass-education-and-the-secret-sauce-for-improving-school-performance), via the BPEA EQT Mid-Market Growth Partnership. So yes -- **School Bytes is a Compass company**.

**Key modules:**
- **Attendance** -- roll marking, late arrivals/early leavers, absence communication

### Hero

Hero is a **learner-centred school management and learning portfolio platform** focused primarily on **Australian primary schools**. It combines a School Management System (SMS) with a Learning Management System (LMS), emphasising real-time learning visibility for teachers and parents. Hero is an **NSW DoE AMPS-approved supplier** for finance.

**Product structure (modular):**

| Component | What it covers |
|---|---|
| **Starter Pack** | Pre-loaded NSW DoE curriculum/syllabus-aligned learning goals, digital learning portfolios, media sharing, basic assessment and reporting |
| **Administration Kit** | Attendance (individual + group roll marking, absence processing), wellbeing & behaviour tracking, suspensions, sickbay register, medical & medications management, groups/rooms/staff management, data analysis tools, reporting & analytics |
| **Finance Kit** | Student billing, integrated payment processing (AMPS-approved) |
| **Communications Kit** | School bookings, surveys, permission notes, caregiver engagement |

**Power Ups (add-ons):**
- **Pages** -- personalised content sharing and learning tracking
- **Goals** -- custom goals and digital badges for student agency
- **Reporting** -- customisable student report pages and parental visibility
- **Milestones** -- progress and achievement expectation tracking

**Key differentiator:** Hero's strongest selling point is the **learning portfolio / LMS layer** -- real-time capture of student learning with photos, videos, and documents shared to parents via the Hero App. This is something School Bytes, Compass, and Sentral do not emphasise. Hero positions itself as a tool that makes learning visible, not just administration efficient.

**Certifications:** Safer Technologies for Schools (ST4S) security certification.

## 2. Feature Overlap Matrix (K-12 Platforms)

The K-12 platforms (School Bytes, Compass, Sentral, Hero) overlap heavily in core admin features. They are direct competitors in the NSW school administration market. The [ACCC noted](https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/public-registers/documents/Global%20Payments_School%20Bytes%20-%20Statement%20of%20Issues_1.pdf) that AMPS-approved suppliers of Student Finance Software in NSW include Sentral, School Bytes, Compass, and now Hero.

| Feature Area | School Bytes | Compass | Sentral | Hero | Millennium FAST |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Attendance / Roll Marking** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Student Wellbeing / Behaviour** | Yes | Yes (Chronicle) | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Academic Reports** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (+ portfolios) | No |
| **Learning Portfolios / LMS** | No | No | No | **Yes (core strength)** | No |
| **Student Finance / Payments** | Yes (SAP integrated) | Yes | Yes | Yes (AMPS approved) | No (uni finance reporting) |
| **Parent Portal** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (Hero App) | No |
| **Mobile App (Parents)** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Mobile App (Teachers)** | Limited | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |
| **Event / Excursion Management** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (Bookings) | No |
| **Health / Sick Bay** | Yes | Yes (Sickbay) | Via Wellbeing | Yes (Medical mgmt) | No |
| **Timetabling** | No | Yes | Yes (Scheduling) | No | No |
| **Canteen / Online Orders** | No | Yes | Yes (StudentPayPlus) | No | No |
| **SMS Communication** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Via Comms Kit | No |
| **Analytics / Insights** | Limited | Yes (Pulse) | Yes (Insights) | Yes | Yes (core strength) |
| **Curriculum Management** | Yes | Limited | Yes | Yes (syllabus-aligned) | No |
| **Digital Badges / Goals** | No | No | No | **Yes** | No |
| **HR / Staff Management** | No | Yes (Time Card) | Limited | Limited | Yes |
| **Budget / Financial Reporting** | No | No | Yes (AP, POs) | No | Yes (core strength) |
| **Financial Aid Tracking** | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| **Research Administration** | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| **ERP Integration Layer** | SAP (DoE) | Own ecosystem | Third-party integrations | Own ecosystem | Banner, PeopleSoft, etc. |

### Key observations on K-12 overlap:

1. **Near-total overlap in core admin features.** Attendance, wellbeing, academic reports, parent portals, and student finance are offered by all four K-12 platforms. These are table-stakes features.

2. **Hero is the outlier with learning portfolios.** Hero uniquely combines SMS admin with an LMS-style learning portfolio (real-time photo/video capture of student work, digital badges, goal-setting). The other three platforms are pure administration tools. This makes Hero particularly appealing to primary schools focused on visible learning and student agency.

3. **School Bytes is strongest in NSW public school finance**, with deeper SAP integration (NSW DoE's finance backbone). The ACCC found School Bytes' finance product is considered higher quality but more expensive than competitors.

4. **Compass is the broadest platform** with 40+ modules including timetabling, canteen ordering, and analytics (Pulse). It is the most used nationally.

5. **Sentral has the strongest business management suite** among K-12 tools, with accounts payable, purchase orders, and payment gateway features that go beyond student fees.

6. **Hero is primary-school focused**; School Bytes is NSW-centric; Compass and Sentral serve all Australian states plus international markets.

7. **Now that Compass owns School Bytes**, the combined entity controls two of the AMPS-approved student finance suppliers, which is why the ACCC scrutinised the merger. Hero's recent AMPS finance approval adds a fourth competitor to this space.

## 3. Do Universities Use These K-12 Tools?

**No.** Universities do not use School Bytes, Compass, or Sentral. These platforms are purpose-built for K-12 school administration and are scoped to that context (roll marking by class, parent permission notes, behaviour tracking, etc.).

Universities have fundamentally different needs:
- **Scale**: tens of thousands of students vs hundreds
- **Complexity**: multiple faculties, research programs, postgraduate pipelines
- **Compliance**: TEQSA, ESOS Act, CRICOS for international students
- **Finance**: HECS-HELP/FEE-HELP loan administration, research grants
- **Student lifecycle**: applications, offers, enrolments, progression, graduation, alumni
- **Research**: grant management, ethics approvals, publication tracking

Millennium FAST is the only tool in the original list that serves higher education, and it operates as a **reporting/BI layer** on top of existing university ERPs -- not as a standalone student management system.

## 4. Systems Australian Universities Actually Use

### Primary Student Management Systems (SMS)

| System | Vendor | Australian Presence | Notable Aus Uni Clients |
|---|---|---|---|
| **TechnologyOne Student Management** | TechnologyOne (ASX: TNE, Brisbane) | Dominant. 60%+ of Australian higher ed. 2M+ students. | University of Melbourne, UTS, Curtin, QUT, Victoria University |
| **Ellucian Banner** | Ellucian (US) | Growing. Major recent wins. | Monash University, Western Sydney University |
| **Callista** | Tribal Group (now Ellucian) | Legacy. Originally built at Deakin Uni in the 1990s. Licenced to 12+ unis. | Deakin, and historically many Go8 universities |
| **Oracle PeopleSoft Campus Solutions** | Oracle | Legacy. ~11 Australian unis historically. | Federation University |
| **SITS:Vision** | Tribal Group (now Ellucian) | Some presence via Tribal. 70% of UK higher ed. | Limited in Australia (more UK/NZ) |

### Reporting & Business Intelligence Overlays

| System | Vendor | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Millennium FAST** | MCSL | Financial reporting, budgeting, student aid tracking. Sits on top of Banner/PeopleSoft. |
| **TechnologyOne Analytics** | TechnologyOne | Built-in analytics within the TechnologyOne ecosystem. |
| **Power BI / Tableau** | Microsoft / Salesforce | Generic BI tools widely used across Australian unis for custom dashboards. |

### Other Enterprise Systems in Australian Universities

| System | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Salesforce** | CRM for student recruitment, marketing, alumni engagement |
| **Microsoft Dynamics 365** | CRM alternative to Salesforce |
| **Moodle / Canvas / Blackboard** | Learning Management Systems (LMS) -- not student admin |
| **Allocate+** | Timetabling |
| **Syllabus Plus** | Timetabling (Tribal/Scientia) |
| **MYOB / SAP** | Finance and HR (separate from student systems) |
| **Workday** | HR and finance (newer entrant) |

### Key Takeaway for Universities

The Australian university SMS market is dominated by **TechnologyOne** (homegrown, ASX-listed, 60%+ market share) with **Ellucian** (via Banner and the Callista/Tribal acquisitions) as the main challenger. Legacy Oracle PeopleSoft installations still exist but are declining. Universities do not use K-12 tools -- the domains are completely separate.
